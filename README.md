**Executive Summary**

This document introduces the project of establishing an investment company that provides consulting
services, information and professional guidance to farmers, investors in agriculture and garden owners,
so that these services and applications produced by the project will be the main source of agricultural
information in Jordan.
These services target the community interested in agriculture and build a network of agricultural
producers and suppliers of agricultural materials and devices to develop the agriculture sector by
providing agricultural guidance and choosing the appropriate agricultural tools and materials.
The project generates revenues through subscriptions that allow the farmer and gardener to obtain
continuous professional information and advice, and by acting as an intermediary platform between
sellers and farmers and obtaining a sale margin in exchange for that. The project also aims to obtain
support and assistance from agencies that provide support for the development of agricultural
production.

The project requires a team of employees to operate and develop the project consisting of management,
marketing manager, marketing employees, customer support team, programmer and operator of
programs and systems and an agricultural expert to write content.
The operation of the project requires the provision of software systems and applications, and a content
management system. These systems will be installed on cloud services. The implementation of the
project requires the participation of parties that produce information and studies in the field of
agriculture to enrich the company's website with recent information and related studies.
The budget of the project was estimated in the third year so that it begins to achieve profits, as it is
expected that the expenditures will reach 259,200 dinars, and the revenues will reach 290,000 so that
the project will achieve the remaining profits of 30,800 dinars.
The business plan describes in detail the team working on the project, customers and the timetable for
